How to build
============
1. Install: make DRM_DRIVER_INC_DIR=DRM/DRIVER/include/uapi KERNEL_SRC=path/to/kernel-src/ install
   Clean:   make clean

How to use
===========================
1. Put libvs_bo_helper.so into board directory which is exported as LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

2. For function drm_vs_get_align_size:
   Get aligned width and height accoring to input format and tile mode/dec/PVRIC tile mode.

3. For function drm_vs_bo_config:
   Prepare parameters required by DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB for each plane.

   Note: in the case of dec, struct drm_vs_bo_param.height represents the virtual height
   with tile status buffer;
   In the case of PVRIC, struct drm_vs_bo_param.height represents the virtual height
   with header section buffer.
